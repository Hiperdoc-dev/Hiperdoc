# Hiperdoc
Nice to meet you, I am Diego (aka Hiperdoc), an videogame developer! I know the basics of python programming, and I am on my way to learn C#. I develop my videogames in S&box, a videogame platform on the source 2 engine (Half-Life Alyx and CS2). I'm always looking for new knowledge and horizons to face. I learn from other people as much as I can, and I'm always willing to learn something new every day.
